For this project I was given starter code for a treasure hunt game that included the environment setup with the end goal of creating a deep Q-learning algorithm to train a pirate agent. In the code I developed , I implemented the logic for initializing the pirate's starting position in free cells, the decision making process where the pirate chooses actions either by exploration or exploitation, storing experiences in the replay buffer, training the neural network and updating weights, and tracking game outcomes to evaluate the agent's performance. 

Computer scientists develop algorithms and systems to solve complex real world problems and improve the way technology interacts with the world. This project demonstrated how reinforcement learning can be used to create intelligent systems that have a meaningful impact. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into smaller steps, identifying possible solutions, and then implementing and testing to ensure the solution works effectively. My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the technology is reliable, fair and transparent. For this project I made sure the pirate agent behaved consistently and as intended, while also writing clear and maintainable code for future use and improvement.
